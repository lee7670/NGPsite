        <p class="blogbody">It has been exactly one month (give or take a couple of hours) since NextGen Printing launched in June. We have taken great strides in improving the company since its launch. We expanded our social media presence to LinkedIn and Twitter, completed a fundraising T-shirt campaign that sold nearly twice our initial goal of shirts, made great progress in de-bugging our website based on user feedback, and began our customer contact campaign. As we steamroll into the next month we plan on further improving our website, expanding our customer base, and finally implementing a systems for online orders. Once again, we always appreciate and support and feedback â€“ if anything catches your eye contact us at support@thinkbeyondink.net.

-Think Beyond Ink.
