                    <p class ="answer">
                    3D printing uses the principles of additive manufacturing to create 3D objects out of design files. Additive manufacturing means building up from scratch rather than subtractive manufacturing which cuts away at a piece until the desired object is obtained. The printers we use lay down layers of melted plastic and build from the bottom up, using data from the files to determine when and where to extrude plastic. This creates the 3D object.</p>

                <div id="B" class="div"><p class = "answer">
                    There are endless applications to 3D printing. The most obvious is printing out parts for different systems in a cheap and efficient manner. Gears, car parts, facial reconstructions, even other 3D printers can be created. Studies have shown successful experiments in which organs were 3D-printed using a biodegradable mold and stem cells. Recently, prosthetic limbs have taken a hold in the 3D printing market. The possibilities are endless.

                    <p class = "answer">
                        3D printers can use several different types of materials. Thermoplastics (PLA or ABS), metal, rubber, chocolate, plaster, modelling clay, etc. The types of materials we use at NGP are ABS and PLA plastic. However, we mostly work with ABS. Jobs requested in PLA will take additional time and will include an additional charge.

                    <p class = "answer">
                        Each layer in a print can range from 0.1 - 0.3 millimeters, depending on what level of detail is required.

                    <p class = "answer">
                        We can print very thin wall thicknesses down to less than a milimeter thick, the minimum height is about 1 mm.

                    <p class = "answer">
                        Printing layers at 0.1 millimeters per layer gives us the ability to make extremely intricate designs and include very high levels of details in products.

                    <p class = "answer">
                        It depends. Printing objects in one color is possible, but will cost extra. Printing objects in multiple colors is extremely difficult and may not be possible given our resources. If multiple colors are requested, we will see if we are able to fulfill the request to the best of our ability. This will include several additional charges (for each color, as well as the cost for chemical smoothing, which will most likely be required) and will take a much longer time.

                    <p class = "answer">
                        CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design. This is a technology that allows individuals to create their own designs in a program, either in 2D or 3D. The program then allows you to save that design in a file type that can be used by a 3D printer to print out your object.

                        Submit a request through our website. You will receive a confirmation email shortly after and another email within a few days giving you an upper-limit cost on your project. You will have 24 hours to cancel your order during this period. If you decide to cancel after, there will be an additional charge. After your print is complete, we will send you pictures of the resulting print, asking if this is satisfactory. If so, we will ship it out. If not, we will re-print at a minor charge (unless the original print is horrendous).

                        If you lack experience in using CAD or would like someone to help you complete your design, you may contact us or submit a request through our website to commission our CAD services. This is a separate service from the 3D prints so it comes with its own costs.

Additionally, we provide CAD services for those inexperienced in the field, whereas many 3D printing services do not.
