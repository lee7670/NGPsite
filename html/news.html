        <h1 class="bloghead">Welcome to NGP</h1>
        <p class="bloghead">By Daniel Suh</p>
        <p class="blogbody">Welcome to the launch of NextGenPrinting, a small 3D printing and CAD service-oriented company looking to support students, artists, and small companies with our services. For the longest time, we were talking about forming a start-up such as this one. Finally, our dream has become a reality. From all of us at NGP, we would like to extend thanks to our friends and families for supporting us thus far.  Explore the website and follow us on <a class="bloglink" href="https://www.facebook.com/NGPthinkbeyondink">Facebook</a> as our company grows so that we may better strengthen our community and help you make your dreams into realities. If you have any questions for us, please email us at <a class="email" href="mailto:support@thinkbeyndink.net?Subject=NGP%20Inquiry" target="_top">support@thinkbeyondink.net</a>. Thank you all again for your support!

        <h1 class="bloghead">A Successful T-Shirt Campaign!</h1>
        <p class="bloghead">By Theodore Lee</p>
        <img class="blogbody" src="../images/NGPstaff.jpg"/>
        <p class="blogbody">When we first started our T-Shirt campaign, it was mostly a way for us to get T-Shirts for ourselves and maybe cover some of the costs of buisiness cards, but thanks to all the support we have been given, we sold twice as many shirts as we hoped for! This has been a great start to our company and has given us extra motivation to make this service as the best local 3D printing service there is. As we go into our second month of operation, we are now fully into our pr and contact gathering phase. We are inviting anyone who is interested in either ordering from NGP or finding out what we can do for them to contact us at <a class="email" href="mailto:support@thinkbeyndink.net?Subject=NGP%20Inquiry" target="_top">support@thinkbeyondink.net</a> and we will contact you as soon as possible. In addition, we now are on both <a class="bloglink" href="http://twitter.com/Thinkbeyondink">Twitter</a> and <a class="bloglink" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/5239975">Linkedin</a>! Follow and connect with us and tell us what we can do for you!
