                <p style="margin-bottom:50px">After a successful freshman year at the University of Michigan, I am looking to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree with a minor in Multidisciplinary Design. My research at Montefiore Hospital on cancer cells led me to the marvels of 3D bioprinting, and thus began my interest in 3D printing. I founded an Entrepreneurs’ Club at Edgemont High School. We received an educational grant and purchased a 3D printer for our school with the money. I continued to expand my entrepreneurial experiences by participating in MPowered Entrepreneurship. My team developed a vlogging site that connected student entrepreneurship groups across the country. Besides entrepreneurial experience, I have accumulated other skills during my time at Michigan. I am capable of programming in C++ and HTML/CSS, and am familiar with modeling software such as NX 8.5 and AutoCad. In my spare time, I like to come up with future entrepreneurial projects to pursue and relax with my brothers at the Michigan Chapter of Triangle Fraternity and my friends.
